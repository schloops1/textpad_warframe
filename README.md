## What's the point?
Some people create files of what they need, what they have to sell, what pieces they lack for sets and so on.
This allows those files to have warframe specific words highlighted increasing readability. Also, allows inserting such words easily.
It also allows easy inserting [] surrounded warframe snippets for easy communication or WTB/WTS/WTT.

## Installation
### Textpad
Get Textpad at https://www.textpad.com/download/index.html and install it using the installer.
### Textpad Warframe
* get all syn and tcl files at https://github.com/schloops1/textpad_warframe/releases/tag/v0.5-alpha
* copy all syn and tcl files into Textpad's sample directory
* in Textpad menus: configure/New Document class then :
* choose a class name Warframe for example then click next
* choose a file extension you'll use for your warframe files and add it. \*.wf for wf files but you can choose your own extension. Click next.
* check enable syntax highlighting and select warframe.syn in the drop down list. Click next.
* click finish

## Utilization
Save a file, in Textpad with your chosen extension (wf in my case) and now, Warframe frames, weapons and so on words will be colored for easy reading. Also, on the left, in the clip book area, select warframe if you want a list of all the frames, weapons etc and be able to insert them by clicking on them. If you select warframe-trade, those words will be surrounded by [] so they can be pasted into warframe chat for trading etc.
